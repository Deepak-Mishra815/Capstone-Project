# Capstone-Project

# TheLook Fintech Data Analysis

## Description
This project involves collecting, processing, and storing data in BigQuery to analyze loan information for TheLook Fintech, a financial technology startup. This project is part of a capstone project, showcasing skills in cloud data analysis and SQL.

## Project Overview
**Objective**: Develop and implement a plan to help the Treasury department use data effectively to track performance and growth.

### Key Business Questions:
1. How can we better monitor our cash flow to make sure the loans we are funding each month are not greater than the money coming in?
2. How can we identify the top reasons customers take out loans from our company?
3. How can we track the locations where borrowers have taken out loans?

### Key Metrics Analyzed:
- **Cash Flow**: Monitor money coming in and going out.
- **Loan Purposes**: Track primary purposes for taking loans.
- **Borrower Locations**: Understand geographical distribution of loans.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Set Up BigQuery Environment**: Opened BigQuery, selected an existing project, and located the Fintech dataset.

2. **Explore Fintech Data**: Identified key tables and columns containing loan amounts and issuance dates.
   ![Task 2 Explored the dataset](screenshots/Capstone Project part 1.Task 2 Explored the dataset.jpg)
   
3. **Import CSV and Create Table**: Imported a CSV file mapping US states to regions and created a standard table.

4. **Join Data from Two Tables**: Combined loan data with region information using SQL JOIN to create a comprehensive report.
